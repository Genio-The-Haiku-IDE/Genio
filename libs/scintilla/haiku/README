# README for building Scintilla for Haiku

Create directory named haiku in main directory of Scintilla and copy all files
there.

Now you can use the makefile provided. Compiled library will be in ../bin.
Make sure you are using GCC11, it will not compile with GCC2.

There is no SciTE port available.

The port is still missing a few things:
- Idler implementation
- ListBox features
- Bidirectional text support

This revision is compatible with Scintilla 5.3.0.

## IME support

INDIC_IME and INDIC_IME+1, respectively.

void NotificationReceived(SCNotification* notification)

## Custom context menu

void ContextMenu(BPoint point)

point is absolute coordinates where context menu should be shown.
